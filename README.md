## To Do List of Improvements

### 1 - Problem
- Too few menu items in order to make the site engaging and professional. Poorly made hover effect with unprofessional underline style.
###### Solution:
- The menu bar received new items + a more engaging user menu experience.

### 2 - Problem
- Main banner menus with a hover that hides the text because of the usage of equal/similar colors.
###### Solution:
- New style applied to the main buttons.

### 3 - Problem
- Lack of engaging areas in the home in order to provide the user with more information about the services/company.
###### Solution:
- Series of new areas added in order to create a richer experience to the user when he accesses the home. The home is the site landing page and it is important to provide more information.

### 4 - Problem
- Lack of footer. It is unprofessional to not have a proper footer in place. Users expect a certain structure when accessing apps and sites. The footer is one of the core elements that can be used to provide hyperlinks, contact information and/or more trust factors about the company.
###### Solution:
- Minimal footer added in other fill this important gap.
